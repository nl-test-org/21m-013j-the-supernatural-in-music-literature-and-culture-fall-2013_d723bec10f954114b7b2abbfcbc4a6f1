Enrollment

This means that each recitation can accept a maximum of 18 students. Priority is given to students who are registered in the class through the [HASS-D](http://shass.mit.edu/undergraduate/hass) lottery, but these students must attend the first two recitation meetings to keep their place in the class. Additional students may enter the class, so long as there are open slots, through the second week of classes.
